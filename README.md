# CEC2022_Comp_Template

This repository was created for the 2022 Canadian Engineering Competition Programming Challenge by myself, Eleanor McSporran, and Ethan Garnier.

The focus of this challange was to interperet limited amounts of historical data and produce a forest fire predicition code, based on a metric designed by the teams.

The purpose of the competition was to challenge contestants to solve a technical problem, from both a coding solution perspective, and also from a engineering problem solving approach.

The competition case document is written in both English and French, due to the national nature of the competition.

For more information on the compeition see the [CFES|FCEG Website](https://cfes.ca/cec/).
